### Telecommunications ChurnQuest

This ChurnQuest project on Airtel customer churn delivers a robust framework for retention through behavioral and service analytics. It echoes proven telecom strategies where targeting complaints and usage patterns cuts churn by 15-25%.
​

Data Analysis Focus - 

Examines demographics, service charges, call durations, complaints, and subscriptions like international/voicemail plans. Techniques include statistical modeling, clustering for segments, trend/seasonal analysis, and economic modeling of churn costs.
​

Key Churn Drivers - 

Frequent complaints, high international call costs, low value-added service engagement, short tenure, and newer customer patterns elevate risk. Vulnerable segments show 2-3x higher churn rates tied to dissatisfaction triggers.

Strategic Insights - 

Predictive models flag high-risk groups for proactive interventions; personalization via tailored plans and onboarding reduces vulnerability. Seasonal trends inform targeted campaigns, while ROI analysis justifies retention spend.
​

Retention Recommendations - 

Optimize pricing for heavy users, enhance service response times, bundle VAS for low-engagement customers, and prioritize onboarding for new subscribers. These shift Airtel to data-driven loyalty, boosting revenue stability.
