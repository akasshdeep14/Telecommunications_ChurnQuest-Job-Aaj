1. The Strategic Executive Summary
Focus: Revenue protection, competitive edge, and business transformation. ChurnQuest is a data-driven initiative designed to stabilize Airtel’s market share by transforming how the company handles customer retention. Rather than reacting to lost accounts, this project identifies the behavioral triggers—such as service friction and pricing pain points—that precede churn. By quantifying the economic impact of customer loss and segmenting high-risk users, the study provides a blueprint for personalized service models and proactive engagement. The goal is to shift Airtel from a traditional reactive stance to a predictive, loyalty-focused strategy that secures long-term profitability.

2. The Data Science & Analytics Overview
Focus: Methodology, modeling, and technical variables. This project applies advanced analytical techniques, including clustering, interaction studies, and predictive modeling, to Airtel’s customer lifecycle data. By correlating churn with specific variables—such as international plan costs, service complaint frequency, and "stickiness" of value-added services—the analysis identifies the exact threshold where a customer becomes a flight risk. The study utilizes economic evaluation and trend analysis to build a risk-scoring framework, allowing for automated, data-backed interventions in segments with the highest churn probability and greatest lifetime value.

3. The "Problem-Solution" Narrative
Focus: The transition from attrition to retention.

The Challenge: Airtel faced rising attrition driven by high service charges and customer dissatisfaction, leading to direct revenue erosion.

The Analysis: "ChurnQuest" deep-dived into usage patterns, discovering that new customers and those with high international usage were the most vulnerable.

The Solution: The project developed targeted onboarding programs for new users and personalized pricing plans for high-usage segments to mitigate "bill shock."

The Result: A strategic pivot toward proactive customer experience management, ensuring that issues are resolved before they lead to a cancellation request.
