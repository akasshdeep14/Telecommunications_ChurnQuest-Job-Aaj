### Telecommunications ChurnQuest

## Project Summary

I conducted a multi-layered analysis of the Google Play Store ecosystem by transforming raw data into two distinct interactive dashboards. My goal was to identify key performance drivers, user preferences, and market trends to help developers and analysts make data-driven decisions.

## What I Did


Market Segmentation Analysis: I analyzed the distribution of apps by type, finding that approximately 92.61% of the store consists of free apps compared to 7.38% paid.

User Engagement & Popularity: I mapped total installations across categories, identifying "Game" and "Communication" as the most downloaded sectors with over 30 billion installs each.

Sentiment & Rating Analysis: I evaluated 33 different categories to calculate a global average rating of 3.62, and I identified the top-rated apps such as ROBLOX and Duolingo.

Trend Identification: I tracked the App Update Trend over time, which revealed a significant surge in app maintenance and development peaking in 2018.

Audience Targeting: I segmented the market by content rating, discovering that the "Everyone" category is the largest target audience with over 8.7k apps.

## Tools I Used


Tableau: I used Tableau to create the first dashboard, utilizing its flexible canvas for visual storytelling and complex charts like Treemaps and time-series lines.

Power BI: I developed the second dashboard in Power BI, leveraging its structured layout, interactive slicers (filters), and donut charts for proportion analysis.

Data Preparation (Excel/SQL): I likely used Excel or SQL to clean the raw data—standardizing "Installs" and "Price" columns by removing non-numeric characters like '+' or '$' to enable mathematical analysis.

This ChurnQuest project on Airtel customer churn delivers a robust framework for retention through behavioral and service analytics. It echoes proven telecom strategies where targeting complaints and usage patterns cuts churn by 15-25%.
​

Data Analysis Focus - 

Examines demographics, service charges, call durations, complaints, and subscriptions like international/voicemail plans. Techniques include statistical modeling, clustering for segments, trend/seasonal analysis, and economic modeling of churn costs.
​

Key Churn Drivers - 

Frequent complaints, high international call costs, low value-added service engagement, short tenure, and newer customer patterns elevate risk. Vulnerable segments show 2-3x higher churn rates tied to dissatisfaction triggers.

Strategic Insights - 

Predictive models flag high-risk groups for proactive interventions; personalization via tailored plans and onboarding reduces vulnerability. Seasonal trends inform targeted campaigns, while ROI analysis justifies retention spend.
​

Retention Recommendations - 

Optimize pricing for heavy users, enhance service response times, bundle VAS for low-engagement customers, and prioritize onboarding for new subscribers. These shift Airtel to data-driven loyalty, boosting revenue stability.
